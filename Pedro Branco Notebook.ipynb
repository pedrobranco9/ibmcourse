Initially, it largely ends up being imagination and inertia… What I have learned in my last few years is that the power of fear is quite tremendous in evolving oneself to think and act differently today, and to ask questions today that we weren’t asking about our roles before. And it’s that mindset change—from an expert-based mindset to one that is much more dynamic and much more learning oriented, as opposed to a fixed mindset—that I think is fundamental to the sustainable health of any company, large, small, or medium._ \n– Murli Buluswar, chief science officer, AIG",
